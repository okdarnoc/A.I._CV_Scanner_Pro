        "## 1. **Extracting Key Information:**\n",
        "   - The program first extracts key information from the job title, duties, and requirements input by the user.\n",
        "   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to identify important keywords and phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. **Generating Question Templates:**\n",
        "   - Based on the extracted information, the program generates question templates.\n",
        "   - These templates are pre-defined structures that allow the program to ask relevant questions about the candidate's experience and qualifications related to the job.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. **Filling in the Templates:**\n",
        "   - The program then fills in the question templates with the specific job-related keywords and phrases extracted in the first step.\n",
        "   - This results in tailored questions that are directly relevant to the job opening.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üìã Example:\n",
        "If the job title is \"Software Engineer\", the duties include \"Develop software applications\", and the requirements specify \"At least 2 years of experience in software development\", the program may generate questions like:\n",
        "   - \"Does the candidate have experience in developing software applications?\"\n",
        "   - \"Has the candidate worked as a software engineer for at least 2 years?\"\n",
        "   \n",
        "This mechanism ensures that the questions are specific, relevant, and targeted to help recruiters and hiring managers quickly assess whether the candidate is a good fit for the job.\n",
